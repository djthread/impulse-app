        ### What is Impulse Detroit?

        We are a group of DJs and music-lovers who want to share the art of production and DJing for
        others, whether they are present at the live event, tune in to the live stream, or subscribe
        to the podcast to listen at will.

        ### How did the station come about?

        Hi! I'm Adam Bellinson, and I am a drum & bass addict. Having mixed the genre, exclusively,
        since 2005, I decided to continue a weekly show some friends were throwing, but had lost
        the venue for. I've been hosting [Techno Tuesday](/#/shows/techno-tuesday) at the Urban Bean
        since January 2015.

        In January 2016, I had a Rocket Fiber internet connection installed to my home. In thinking
        of new applications for my symmetric 1 Gb/s connection, I soon launched a website to host
        Techno Tuesday. A couple months later, we've launched Impulse Detroit -- a group of internet
        shows, dedicated to bringing quality choonage to your ear-holes.
